# Kaggle - Titanic Survival
This project is about predicting the survival of the passengers in titanic using Random decision forests classification method.

Train and test data are collected and the features which are considered for predicting the survival are pre-processed for both train and test dataset. A model is created using Random forest Algorithm for the train dataset and the survival is predicted for the test data with the Random forest model and the results are analyzed.
